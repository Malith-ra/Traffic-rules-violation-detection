						<h2>Literature Survey</h2>
						<p>
							A.	Vehicle Type And Number Plate Detection
						</p>
						<p>Automatic Number Plate Detection technology has made its way into many areas of today's digital environment thanks to the capacity to identify and scan huge quantities of moving cars [2][3]. While the Automatic Number Plate Detection technology may be supplied in many various forms, they all have the same fundamental purpose to offer a very precise vehicle scanning system without any human involvement [2]. Initially, the most essential and crucial step for this kind of system was the successful extraction of the image/video number plate [4][5]. The extraction rate is a measure at which plates have been successfully extracted, with the entire number of input pictures or vehicles identified.  The number plate can be darkened or damaged with dirt or situated beyond the camera's sight (because various cars are placed in different locations at different places on the body of the vehicle) [2]. Algorithms that use geometric characteristics to extract rectangle-formed numbers may have problems if many similar forms are drawn/pasted across the vehicle body. Additional algorithms must also be employed to remove undesirable areas, along with rectangle-shaped features. Number Plate Recognition means that pictures from the desired scene are acquired using a camera on the number plate [3]. An alpha-numeric translation of recorded pictures into a text input is captured by still photos or photographic video and then processed via a series of recognitional algorithms based on photo processing. [3].</p>
						<p> The video surveillance systems are typically intended for operators to monitor protected space remotely or to capture video data as a subsequent analytical archive at a time. Video surveillance is a labor demanding job for controlling a big number of cameras [4]. It is also a laborious job and human observers may quickly lose sight of it. Automation may assist to solve costs and performance problems [5]. It may also release security workers from mundane duties and allow them to concentrate on cognitive work on a higher level that makes greater use of their skills. Intelligent video surveillance in industrial applications is of significant interest since the need for reducing the workforce is increasing.</p>
						<p>
							B.	Parking Violation Detection and Lane Violation Detection
						</p>
						<p>
							The ever-increasing number of violations of traffic rules has become a critical challenge in Sri Lanka. The solution is to install violation detection systems on the expressway. It is an essential part of road security and safety. There is a huge increase with the use of vehicles on the expressway. Consequently, there is an increase in violations of traffic rules. Such violations lead to more road accidents.
						</p>
						<p>
							A real problem related to traffic jams and highway accidents. This may occur due to limited allocation of the traffic police to the expressway. The system acts as an individual system without any assistance from other external systems, such as the sensors. The system can detect violations of vehicle parking and drive wrong lane. The system automatically detects traffic rules violated vehicles by methods of video processing techniques.
						</p>
						<p>Every other videos of camera-based violations tracking system that can operate automated event detection usually includes multi-stage video analysis sequences for CCTV cameras from expressways. The effective detection of illegal parking has captivated research attention from different domains. Researchers are working to develop new algorithms aimed at improving detection accuracy. The majority of these efforts have used videos taken from fixed cameras . Overcoming this issue of the coverage of fixed cameras, recent research have applied alternate solution data sources, including certain biking trajectories, to identify illegal parking. Our research improves on these past researches by using CCTV cameras that could be implemented in object detection. </p>
						<p>
							C.	Vehicle Speed Detection
						</p>
						<p>
							Many researchers have done the system implementation using image and video processing techniques. Some of the authors use videos that are taken from surveillance cameras as inputs.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to , the system is done in three parts. The first part which is the vehicle detection part they have used background subtraction. Here a new method called adaptive background subtraction is used. In adaptive background subtraction, the background image is updating itself and it handles any changes of illuminations. Next for the vehicle tracking, they have separated this task into two parts namely, object segmentation and object labeling, bounding box, and center extraction. In object labeling, first, they have done shadow removal to prevent false detections using some of the properties of a shadow. Then, Convex hull and some other morphological operations are carried out and as the result, the noise removed images that have vehicles as proper blobs are obtained. The second part of the tracking is to track the objects that were detected. In here a unique label is assigned to the vehicle and keep it until it disappears from the scene. And then a bounding box is drawn around the vehicle and the center of the box is calculated and preserved. The final phase which is the speed detection part is separated into two parts. The first part is finding a calibration factor. In here it was done by calibrating the camera. And the second part is speed calculation. Here the speed in km/h is calculated and that speed is updating every 0.5sec.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to , the vehicle speed estimation is divided into four parts. The first part is background reconstruction and update strategy. Here the median method in RGB space is used in background reconstruction and for the background updating process, a mathematical expression is used. The second part is to extract the moving vehicle. For this process, they have combined the three-frame difference method and background difference method and this process is conducted in gray space. The third phase is to obtain the position of the vehicle centroid. This phase is done using a formula created by them. For the last step, which is calculating the speed of the vehicle, they must use a specific formula. Here the camera calibration method is used to map the pixel distance with actual distance.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to , the system implantation is divided into three parts. The first part is object detection. For this, the Gaussian mixture model is used for background subtraction, and for specifying the segments of foreground points DBSCAN clustering is used. Then bounding boxes are used to mark these segments. In the object tracking phase which is the next step they have used Kalman filter and Optical flow methods are used. Then for the last step which is speed estimation weight of the pixel is needed to know. For this, they have divided the width of the road by the pixel representation. Then by calculating the average speed of all the points, the speed of the target is calculated.
						</p>
						<p>
							D.	Reverse Violation Detection
						</p>
						<p>
							Vehicles are clearly an important mode of transportation now and into the. They have revolutionized our way of life, and we can no longer imagine a world without motor vehicles. Even if you already own one or more, their costs continue to fall, and the comfort they provide makes it all the more appealing to purchase new ones. As a result, the amount of cars on the expressway is steadily growing year after year. Simultaneously, the amount of people killed or injured is increasing at an alarming rate.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the globs most pressing health and patient care issues is traffic crashes. According to the World Health Organization [1] [2], more than a million people die every year on the world's roads. In 2010, there were over one thousand car accidents in Sri Lanka. Over $ 23 thousand was wasted as a result of these blunders. Over 45,000 people were killed, and over 2 million people were injured. Every 12 minutes, someone in the country dies in a car accident, equating to around 100 deaths per day [3].
						</p>
						<p>
							Exceeding the posted speed limit is the leading cause of fatalities, accounting for 34.25 percent of all collisions. The red-light signal is responsible for 5.25 percent of all incidents. It is now clear that being above the posted speed limit and failing to obey traffic lights account for about 40% of all crashes. Around 21% of crashes are caused by traffic laws like wrong way driving, overtaking on the right side of the road or failing to keep a safe distance between vehicles.

						</p>
						<p>
							Connecting the CCTV surveillance to the central server, so that data collected by one of them is forwarded to that server, is the most expensive network infrastructure. This solution's other side effect is outlined in [4]. "The goal of speed cameras and traffic lights," according to the author, "is to prevent collisions." Residents on Long Avenue, on the other hand, believe that traffic light camera collisions are to blame. They risk losing control of their car or colliding with other cars as a result.
						</p>
						<h2>Research Gap</h2>
						<p>
							When comparing the past projects that have done in this area, the system we have developed can identify the rules violations in more effective manner and our system is very cost effective. Other than that, our system also has more other features. They are,

						<p>
							•	There are problems in automatically detecting the type and license plate of the vehicles.
						</p>
						<p>

						<h2>
							Methodology
						</h2>
						<p>
							A.	Vehicle Type And Number Plate Detection
						</p>
						<p>
							This chapter ‘Methodology’ is reserved to discuss about the approach to the
							research and the methodology of conducting research. This chapter put forward,
							the project approach to alternative solutions. For this purpose, the researcher
							presents the hypothesis, then going to the discussion of inputs, outputs, process,
							user, and the features.
						</p>
						<p>
							If a proper application format minimizes problems in the business process,
							it should be easier for them to carry out their work. This is because there
							are problems with using most of the existing systems. Therefore, a wellanalyzed system has been introduced so that all the tasks can be done
							effectively and efficiently with maximum benefits
							The developed traffic rule violation surveillance system has the capability
							to facilitate for following functionalities.

						</p>
						<p>

							• Detect the number plate when a vehicle violates a traffic rule. / Detect new vehicle types.
						</p>
						<p>
							The functional requirements describe the service that the program should
							deliver. They provide information on the software system or its
							components. A function is just the inputs, behavior, and outputs of a
							software system. It may be a computational, user interaction, data
							manipulation, business process, or any other function that specifies what a
							system can do.
						</p>
						<p>
							The following are the main functional requirements identified by the
							researcher about the system
						</p>
						<p>
							1. Vehicle type detection
						</p>
						<p>
							2. License plate detection
						</p>
						<p>
							•   Construct a conceptual framework
						</p>
						<p>
							Establishing the issue domain and research questions is an essential
							first step. It will turn up relevant material that will be beneficial to this
							project. It's also a fantastic chance to learn more about machine
							learning as well as object recognition, which can subsequently be used
							to the system's development.

						</p>
						<p>
							B.	Parking Violation Detection and Lane Violation Detection
						</p>
						<p>The proposed system is an expressway vehicle tracking system that has the capability of,</p>
						<p>
							•	Identifying the vehicle number plate
						</p>
						<p>
							•	Identifying the illegal vehicle parking.
						</p>
						<p>
							•	Identifying the road lane violations of vehicle.
						</p>
						<p>
							We suggest a system architecture based on microservices [10] as visualized in Figure 3 . This consists of three main components: 1) data storage; 2) microservices; and 3) interactive mapping and visual analytics. And also, we focusing new deep learning techniques to improve performance for our proposed system.
						</p>
						<p>
							• Deep Learning Algorithms: Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN)
						</p>
						<p>
							Throughout real-world scenarios, there seem to be several rules that evaluate how much a vehicle is an illegal car park, also including parking in exclusive zones, which passes that certain short period. In order to accurately develop this research to these guidelines on parking, we are developing an objective of parking aims to guide time stamps, coordinated parking and number plate of vehicles detected in videos. Throughout that research, we are allowing expressway management to identify objects as parking areas. We also could use the thing to evaluate whether illegally parked vehicles. The illegally parking vehicles identified are drawn with a red rectangle.
						</p>
						<p>
							• Analysis of Trajectory – Detects lane violations.
						</p>
						<p>
							This segment presents the methodology of the paths of moving objects as well as the lane changing of violation information on multiple objects. Many of the expressway are guided in two directions, and the roadways are divided by barriers. The identification line is located at a half position mostly on vehicle over taking side of the road image (Fig. 3.3). Highway lane flow for both lanes is classified sequentially. Whenever the lane’s path crosses the identification line, the object's data is recorded. After this, it is possible to obtain the set of vehicles in various directions and categorizations within a certain time period.
						</p>
						<p>
							This segment outlines the major structure of the identification of car parks and the detection of lane violations. The first step is to enter the visual information of the driving environment. Then the exterior of the road is retrieved and split. Its YOLOv3 deep object identify algorithm is used for extracting a object in the expressway. After this, the ORB extraction functionalities are executed on identify the vehicle box to finalize the multi-object monitoring and to achieve road violation updates.

						<p>
							•	From above phases position of the vehicle is obtained in terms of pixel units.
						</p>
						<p>
							•	In calculating speed, initially the change in pixels is calculated using coordinates obtained.

						</p>
						<p>
							•	Then the distance in terms of pixel units is converted into the SI units of distance.

						</p>
						<p>
							•	The time elapsed is obtained by camera’s frame rate settings (fps value).
						</p>
						<p>
							•	Then the speed is calculated by multiplying distance by fps value and then by 3.6 which is used to convert the speed into kilometers per hours.

							•	In the reverse violation, first system check if vehicle is driving on wrong direction, then system detect that object.

						</p>
						<p>
							•	Then individual frames are point into the specific object and display this is a reverse violation.

						</p>
						<p>
							•	In the overtake violation, when one object is overtaking another object, It will be detected first using YOLO.

						</p>
						<p>
							•	After that set the annotations to the overtaking vehicle object and check whether lights are on/off. If light is off within specific time duration, It will be detecting and give output as an overtaking violation, Otherwise usually system run its own way.
